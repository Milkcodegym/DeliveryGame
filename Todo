PROJECT ROADMAP AND TODO LIST

PHASE 0: CRITICAL DECISIONS (BLOCKERS)
  These items must be decided before further development to avoid code rewrites.

  Graphics
    Decide on art style (URGENT/IMPORTANT)

  Camera
    Decide on 1st person vs 3rd person perspective

  World Design
    Decide on the specific section of thessaloniki to import

PHASE 1: CORE ENGINE & WORLD
Building the physical simulation environment.

  Map Implementation:
    Add final map data of the chosen city section
    Add sea or boundary limits
    Add landmark locations
    Work on scaling and rendering optimization (important)

  Traffic System
    Implement traffic rules (lights, lanes)
    Implement collision avoidance (traffic vs traffic)
    Add interaction logic (traffic respecting delivery entrances)

PHASE 3: DELIVERY MECHANICS (CORE LOOP)
The logic defining how jobs are created and completed.

  Delivery Logic
    Define delivery collision boxes and entrance triggers
    Add icons for pickup and drop-off locations
    Finalize scoring system (Time, Distance, Safety)
    Add tip modifier logic (based on general time)

  Job Classes & Modifiers
    Hot Food (Fast Food): Very fast time constraints
    Hot Food (Restaurant): Higher pay, high driving sensitivity constraint
    Drinks (Cafe): Very fast time constraints
    Drinks (Bar): Higher pay, extreme sensitivity (spill risk)
    Cold Food (Market): No constraints
    Cold Food (Supermarket): Extra weight physics (handling penalty)

  Map Editor Tools
    Fix editability of POIs
    Add functionality to assign delivery kinds to specific shop nodes

PHASE 4: ECONOMY & FRICTION
Systems that cost money or add strategic depth.
 
    Finalise car upgrades
    Define item inventory for each shop type

  Law & Order
    Implement Parking logic (Fees for illegal parking)

  //note on optimisation: add music files in midi format?? (να δουμε αν αξίζει γτ θελει εξτρά libraryw)

  add icons on map
  handle map edges, add shops and service centers, and gas stations.
  decide on pickup and delivery options: interactable on shop doors or pickup areas.
  unlock mycarstats and speedometer, fuelometer after finishing tutorial.
  add other keyboard shortcuts?
  Add actual shop locations / parking spots to pull into?
  fix camera collisions - many bugs

  fix map app building issues
  game not saving on exit? (needs testing)

add a bicycle or motorcycle. then, fix graphics for locations instead of spheres, find icons for map, fix loading and start screen graphics and loading, dealership loading screen
add dealership location to map
jump easter egg
make parks spawn in city gaps

add a notification informing you of hospital bills when you crash and respawn
when out of fuel, emergency fuel takes 25% of your money.
safety warning resets your speed
make random event hitboxes smaller
fix building clipping issues
fix g-force meter not working
fuel balancing, tank empties a bit too quickly
fix broken traffic (+traffic models?)
fix broken camera lerp
optimise camera collision?
add g forces and temperature logic?
add cargo integrity meter
fix traffic models

Add accident and road work road signs
traffic goes through road events?
