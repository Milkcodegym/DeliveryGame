PROJECT ROADMAP AND TODO LIST

PHASE 0: CRITICAL DECISIONS (BLOCKERS)
  These items must be decided before further development to avoid code rewrites.

  Graphics
    Decide on art style (URGENT/IMPORTANT)

  Camera
    Decide on 1st person vs 3rd person perspective

  World Design
    Decide on the specific section of thessaloniki to import

PHASE 1: CORE ENGINE & WORLD
Building the physical simulation environment.

  Map Implementation:
    Add final map data of the chosen city section
    Add sea or boundary limits
    Add landmark locations
    Work on scaling and rendering optimization (important)

  Traffic System
    Implement traffic rules (lights, lanes)
    Implement collision avoidance (traffic vs traffic)
    Add interaction logic (traffic respecting delivery entrances)

PHASE 2: PLAYER INTERFACE & CONTROLS
The primary way the player interacts with the world.

  Phone UI
    Decide on screen layout (Full screen vs Overlay)
    Implement Maps App (Navigation, GPS)
    Implement Efood App (Job listing and acceptance)

PHASE 3: DELIVERY MECHANICS (CORE LOOP)
The logic defining how jobs are created and completed.

  Delivery Logic
    Define delivery collision boxes and entrance triggers
    Add icons for pickup and drop-off locations
    Implement scoring system (Time, Distance, Safety)
    Add tip modifier logic (based on general time)

  Job Classes & Modifiers
    Hot Food (Fast Food): Very fast time constraints
    Hot Food (Restaurant): Higher pay, high driving sensitivity constraint
    Drinks (Cafe): Very fast time constraints
    Drinks (Bar): Higher pay, extreme sensitivity (spill risk)
    Cold Food (Market): No constraints
    Cold Food (Supermarket): Extra weight physics (handling penalty)

  Map Editor Tools
    Fix editability of POIs
    Add functionality to assign delivery kinds to specific shop nodes

PHASE 4: ECONOMY & FRICTION
Systems that cost money or add strategic depth.

  Car Status
    Implement Fuel system (Consumption + Gas Stations)
    Implement Damage/Health system
    Create Mechanic Screen (Repairs and Upgrades)
    Implement "Death" penalty (Extra towing/medical fees)
    Create upgradable MyCarMonitor app with G-force/Temp data and other car related stats

  Shops & Upgrades
    Decide on E-shops (Phone) vs Physical Stores (Drive-to)
    Define power-ups and car upgrades
    Define item inventory for each shop type

  Law & Order
    Implement Parking logic (Fees for illegal parking)
